My name is Ziya Suzen and this is my blog! I live and work in the UK enjoying writing and maintaining software. You can find out what Iâ€™ve been working on, and hopefully a little help on similar projects you might be building.

You can find me on Github as mtmk or on Linked-in as ziyas. I go by the nick name Maxwell Troy Milton King on Stackoverflow as well.

Enjoy!
