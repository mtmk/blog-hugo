Switched from GitHub Pages to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) to host my blog.
My repos are still kept on GitHub. On top of static site serving, Netlify seems
to have offerings for executed or dynamic content as well, which I might
make use of in the future.

I'm keeping the repo here: github.com/mtmk/blog-hugo/ziyas-blog
