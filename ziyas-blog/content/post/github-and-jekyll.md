It's been a while since I posted any entries. I have been quite busy with stuff and so on (standard excuses). Now my blog is back on-line thanks to a super service provided by Github: [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) and the awesome project [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com): A static site generation tool.

Basically you can simply have a repo on Github, create a site using Jekyll in there and everything else just works. You can even have your own domain! I really like this service and recommend it to any coder, hacker, geek (or whatever you call yourself as long as you can use git in some fashion).

Enjoy!
